                        <div class="instruction-list">
                            <h3>Instructions</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <span>01.</span>
                                    Preparing the Ingredients:
                                    In a large mixing bowl, whisk together:

                                    1 cup all-purpose flour

                                    1 tablespoon sugar

                                    1 teaspoon baking powder

                                    1/2 teaspoon salt

                                    In a separate bowl, mix the wet ingredients:

                                    1 large egg

                                    3/4 cup milk

                                    2 tablespoons melted butter

                                    1 teaspoon vanilla extract

                                    Gently fold 1/2 cup fresh raspberries into the wet mixture, being careful not to crush the fruit.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span>02.</span>
                                    Combining the Wet and Dry Ingredients:
                                    Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.
                                    
                                    Stir gently with a spoon or whisk until just combined. The batter should be a bit lumpy—do not overmix.
                                    
                                    If the batter is too thick, add a small splash of milk to loosen it to your desired consistency.

                                <li>
                                    <span>03.</span>
                                    Cooking the Pancakes:
                                    Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and add a little butter to coat the surface.

                                    Once the pan is hot, pour 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the skillet for each pancake.

                                    Cook for about 2-3 minutes, until bubbles start to form on the surface.

                                    Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and fully cooked through.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span>04.</span>
                                    Serving the Pancakes:
                                    Stack the pancakes on a plate, layering them as you go.

                                    Add a pat of butter on top of the stack and drizzle with honey for sweetness.

                                    Optional: Top with extra raspberries for a burst of color and flavor.

                                    Enjoy these delicious raspberry pancakes immediately while they’re warm and fluffy!

                            <h3>Notes</h3>
                            <div class="notes-item">

                                <p>Batter Consistency: If the pancake batter seems too thick, add a small amount of milk to loosen it up. You want it to be thick enough to hold its shape on the skillet, but pourable enough to spread slightly when cooked.

                                    Fresh Raspberries: Gently fold the raspberries into the batter to prevent them from breaking apart. You can also use frozen raspberries, but make sure to thaw them and gently pat them dry to prevent excess moisture in the batter.
                                    
                                    Cooking Tip: Ensure the pan is well-heated before adding the batter. This helps the pancakes cook evenly and prevents them from becoming too greasy. You can test the heat by sprinkling a drop of water on the skillet—if it sizzles, the pan is ready.
                                    
                                    Topping Variations: Feel free to add other toppings, like whipped cream, a sprinkle of powdered sugar, or even a drizzle of maple syrup for extra sweetness.
                                    
                                    Storage: Leftover pancakes can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Reheat them in a toaster or on a skillet to restore their fluffiness.</p>
